**Overview** 

Welcome to the Airline Recommendation System project. The system combines machine learning and deep learning models to predict user experience for airline services based on customer ratings and sentiment analysis of customer reviews.

**Introduction**
The goal of this project is to enhance the user experience in choosing airlines by leveraging customer ratings and sentiment analysis of reviews. Two datasets were utilized to achieve this:

airline_reviews_cleaned: Contains ratings provided by customers based on various flight parameters. A machine learning model was trained to predict customer satisfaction.

airline_sentiment: Consists of textual reviews posted by customers. A deep learning model was trained for sentiment analysis to determine if the sentiment is positive or negative.
